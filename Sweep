Line Sweep (or Sweep Line) is an algorithmic technique where we sweep an imaginary line (x or y axis) and solve various problem.
There would be an event (entry or event) and based on that we update the information and then return result.

This is going to be a long post, so I have divided into 3 parts.

1D Easy/Medium problem.
1D Hard.
2D geometric problems.
There could be errors, please post in comments.
Also suggest more problem to be added to this list.
Inviting @votrubac @lee215 to give suggestion for improvment.
